    abstract = {This paper shows that the EGARCH-M model should be estimated with caution. Regardless of the assumption made regarding the conditional error distribution, the EGARCH-M model is sensitive to the choice of starting values and the degree of computer precision. However, a simple forecasting example shows that these issues only become a concern when the EGARCH-M model is estimated on a high-precision computer, under the assumption that the conditional errors follow a generalized error distribution. The instability of the risk aversion parameter in the mean equation is the greatest influence on these results.}

    abstract = {Traditional hedging is only applied to minimise uncertainty about the financial asset's value at some particular future time when the hedge is closed, and it is only concerned with one scenario. However, dynamic hedging is used with simulation techniques to value the financial assets and to measure risk. The framework relies on solving the traditional hedging strategy, but it is used to simulate various multi-scenarios for the portfolio value. The purpose of this paper is to apply Monte Carlo to simulate the threshold autoregressive conditionally heteroschedastic (TARCH) process to determine the dynamic hedging strategy of the proposed American depositary receipt (ADR) stock portfolios. The empirical study examines Germany and the UK ADR portfolios to reduce China's ADR portfolio risk in the US equity market. It contributes to solving investing in foreign stocks to hedge risky stocks in the US equity market. The result presents that using Germany and the UK's ADR portfolios could lead against the risk of investment of China's ADRs in the US equity market. It can improve the investor's portfolio allocation and protects the profit.},

abstract = {The combination of Deep Learning and GARCH-type models has been proved to be superior to the single models in forecasting of volatility in various markets such as energy, main metals, and especially stock markets. To verify this hypothesis for cryptocurrencies market, we constructed various Deep Learning models based on Feed Forward Neural Networks (DFFNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and evaluated their performance in forecasting the volatility of 27 cryptocurrencies. Then, different hybrid models were built in which the outputs of three GARCH-type models, namely GARCH, EGARCH, and APGARCH, with three different assumptions for the residuals’ distribution were fed into the DFFNN and LSTM networks. In other words, GARCH-type models were utilized as feature extractors and the deep learning models leveraged a sequence of extracted features as their inputs to produce the volatility of the next day. Our findings revealed that not only the deep learning models improve the forecasts of GARCH-type models with any distribution assumption, the forecasts of GARCH-type models as informative features can significantly increase the predictive power of the studied deep learning models; namely, the DFFNN and LSTM models.}

  optabstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
