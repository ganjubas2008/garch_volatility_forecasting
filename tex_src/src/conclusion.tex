As it was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}, any GARCH-based model can be a reliable choice for volatility forecasting, especially in complex markets like Bitcoin. However, it is still important to choose optimal type of model and parameters for practical use.

Another important result was established in Subsection \ref{sec:return_normolize}, stating that normalized returns are likely to normally distributed \[\zeta_t = \frac{R_t}{\sigma_t} \stackrel{d}{\sim} N(0, 1)\]
where \(R_t\) represents returns on day \(t\).

Future research could apply these models to other asset classes or integrate macroeconomic factors and machine learning techniques, but overall, GARCH models remain essential for risk management and trading strategies in volatile markets.
