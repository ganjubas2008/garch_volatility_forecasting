Volatility forecasting is a crucial aspect of financial econometrics, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving markets such as cryptocurrencies. The unpredictability and extreme fluctuations in asset prices pose significant challenges for investors and risk managers. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, first introduced by \cite{bollerslev1987}, provides a robust framework for modeling time-varying volatility.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of GARCH-type models (GARCH, EGARCH, APARCH, etc.) in predicting realized volatility of Bitcoin returns compared to naive models. We employ a comprehensive methodology, including distributional tests and rolling-window predictions, to provide insights into the performance of these models.
