In order to maintain readability we present only few examples of models evaluation metrics in the Tables~\ref{tab:model_metrics_A} and~\ref{tab:model_metrics_B}. 
As can be evident from them, \textsc{GARCH} models significantly outperformed the naive volatility persistence model in our analysis. Among the various GARCH specifications tested, the \textbf{GJR-GARCH(1, 2)} model exhibited nearly the best overall performance. However, it is important to note that the differences in performance among the various GARCH models were pretty huge, typically differing up to 30\%. This indicates that while GARCH models generally provide better forecasts than the naive model, we still should dedicate some time when choosing the best model for our particular data.
